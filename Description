# Supplement-Store-Analysis-in-Power-BI
I have built an interactive Dashboard containing crucial insights with important KPIs.

The task was to make a Dynamic Dashboard in Power BI for the Supplement Stores which are being operated and owned by #PMventures.

The Dashboard provides very crucial insights which will help the business to identify the patterns and trends over the years which further will help them take a better decision.

So, I have developed 2 Dashboards : Out of which the first is Sales Report, which contains the important #KPIs and

- Category and Sub-Category wise Net Sales.

- Net Sales by Region and Continent.

- Net Sales by Year and Month.

The Second one is Gross Margin Year over Year.

KPIs:
- Gross Margin%
- Gross Margin
- Net Sales
- Orders
- Customers.

I have also added some DAX measures, which helped in getting more clarity by going deep in the granularity.

-- A few Key Insights --

- It's been found that Protein Category has the highest Net Sales in every region.

- The highest sold Subcategory is of
Whey Protein.

- North America is the highest consumer of Whey Protein which is a good indication for the business as they can scale up and introduce new products.
